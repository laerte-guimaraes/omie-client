## Usage

To use the lib you must set the credentials to use your Omie instance. First,
you need to create the keys at
[Omie developer page](https://developer.omie.com.br/my-apps/)
or [Omie generate keys](https://app.omie.com.br/developer/generate-key/).
Then, set your credentials:
```ruby
Omie.app_key = "app_key"
Omie.app_secret = "app_secret"
```

**Now that the cliet is properly initialized you can start using it's
functions.**

The available classes of the Omie client corresponds the resources available in
Omie's API.

The lib follows the same design principles of Rail's ActiveRecord.
Each class provides a set of methods that perform direct calls to
Omie's API and return a Plain Old Ruby Objects (PORO) for each corresponding
entry. The resources' instance variables have the same portuguese names of
attributes of their respective JSON payloads.

The available resources are:

* Company (Clientes)

Ongoing Work:

* Procut (Produtos)
* SalesOrder (Ordem de Venda)

Future Versions:

* PurchaseOrder (Ordem de Compra)

### Company Resource

This class aims at manipulating resources available for Omie's companies,
including clients and providers.

> Ref: [Company documentation](https://app.omie.com.br/api/v1/geral/clientes/)

To create a new Company resource you can:
```ruby
company = Omie::Company.create(codigo_cliente_integracao: "XPTO_INTERNAL_CODE", cnpj_cpf: '26742035000190', nome_fantasia: 'Peerdustry Tecnologia LTDA', razao_social: 'Peerdustry Manufatura Compartilhada', email: 'contato@peerdustry.com')

# Update the email locally
company.email = "another@peerdustry.com"

# Update the register on Omie
company.save
```

Search for a specific entry:
```ruby
company = Omie::Company.find(cnpj_cpf: '26742035000190')
```

List all entries:
```ruby
companies = Omie::Company.list
puts companies.class # Array

puts companies.count
companies.each {|c| puts c.nome_fantasia }
```
